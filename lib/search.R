## Extracts all search count information from the supplied FHR days list 
## (data$days or a subset, even empty), and packages it 
## into a convenient form.
## 
## This is intended as a preprocessing step for computing search counts
## by search provider and SAP. It parses out provider and SAP strings, 
## and removes values that are considered invalid. 
## 
## Returns a list with an entry for each day that has valid search counts
## (searches.counts entry), or NULL if none are found in the supplied days list.
## Each entry is itself a list, with entries of the form:
## list(provider = character(...), sap = character(...), count = numeric(...)).
## Element i of the vectors give the search provider, SAP, and count 
## corresponding to that day's i-th search count respectively.

## Computes the search counts for a single day's searches (a single entry
## in the list returned by allSearches()), totaled by
## search provider and SAP.
##
## The provider and SAP identifier strings can optionally be grouped, and the
## search counts will be summed over these groups instead of over the raw 
## identifiers. To do this, supply functions to the arguments provider.grouping 
## and sap.grouping. The functions should map a vector of identifier strings to 
## the corresponding group labels that they should be counted under. The default
## grouping is to use all original identifiers.
##
## Either of the provider or SAP dimensions can be ignored entirely in summing,
## ie. all its identifiers are lumped into a single, trivial group, and the 
## results will not include it. To do this, set the appropriate grouping
## argument to NULL. Seting both to NULL means computing overall total searches.
##
## If either of the grouping functions can return NA, the counts for groups
## labelled NA can be removed from the output by setting removeNA = TRUE.
## This can be used to restrict counts to a subset of interest: make the 
## grouping functions return NA for other searches and drop them from the
## output. If there is grouping along both dimensions, this will remove counts
## for which the group labels for either provider or sap is NA. By default,
## NA groups are not removed and are treated the same as the other groups.
##
## The retun value depends on which of the provider and SAP dimensions are used
## for counting. If both grouping arguments are NULL, the result is a scalar 
## count of overall total searches for that day. If one grouping argument is 
## NULL, the result is a named vector mapping group names to search counts for 
## that group. If both grouping dimensions are used, the result is a 
## two-dimensional array, with provider groups as row names and SAP groups as 
## column names. If removeNA caused all search counts to be removed, the result
## is NULL.
searchCountValues <- function(searchday, provider.grouping = identity, 
                                    sap.grouping = identity, removeNA = FALSE) {
    ## If both grouping arguments are NULL, just return the total count.
    if(is.null(provider.grouping) && is.null(sap.grouping))
        return(sum(searchday$count))
    ## Otherwise apply grouping and use tapply.

## Computes daily search counts by search provider and SAP.
##
## Input is either the data$days list (default), or the list returned 
## by allSearches(). The input type should be flagged by setting 'preprocess' 
## to TRUE for the former and FALSE for the latter. 
##
## Search counts can be returned either as overall daily totals, or grouped
## or subsetted by either search provider name or SAP name. This behaviour
## is controlled using the 'provider' and 'sap' arguments. 
##
## In grouping, the search counts will be assigned to groups based on the 
## search providers or SAP string identifiers. The method for assigning groups
## can be specified in a variety of ways, which apply to both 'provider' and 
## 'sap' arguments: 
##  - TRUE, meaning that there will be a separate count for each raw identifier
##    (no grouping). This is the default.
##  - FALSE or NULL, meaning that counts will not be split across this dimension
##    (ie. all values belong to a single, trivial group)
##  - A function which maps a vector of identifiers to group names (or NA)
##  - A list whose names are the group names, and whose elements are functions
##    mapping a vector of identifiers to a vector of booleans indicating whether
##    each should be assigned to that group. Identifiers that are not assigned
##    to any group by any of these functions will be assigned to a group named NA.
##    To specify another for this "unassigned" group, the list should contain
##    an entry NA whose name is the desired group name. An example of this form
##    is: list(yahoo = function() {...}, google = function() {...}, other = NA).
##  An input in any different form generates an error.
## 
## By default, any searches assigned to a group labelled NA will be treated
## the same as any other group. However, setting removeNA = TRUE will cause
## the NA group to be removed from the output. This can be used for subsetting
## searches. To only count searches belonging to a certain subset of interest, 
## assign the others to a group labelled NA (either explicitly in the function
## form or automatically using the list form), and use removeNA = TRUE. If both
## the provider and sap dimensions have NAs, this will drop counts for which 
## either dimension is NA.
## 
## Returns a list with an entry for each day that has searches (as returned by
## allSearches()), except for days for which all searches were removed by 
## setting removeNA = TRUE. If there are no such days, returns NULL.
## Each entry is of the form returned by searchCountValues(), either a scalar
## or a one- or two-dimensional array.
