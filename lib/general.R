## Retrieves the sequence of valid version updates from the supplied FHR 
## days list.

## Returns a vector mapping dates that saw version updates to the full version
## number updated to on that day, ordered chronologically. 
## If there were multiple updates on the day, this is the last update on the day. 
## 
## If no valid updates were found across the input days, returns NULL.

## Find the dates of a specific weekday closest to a vector of dates.
## For example, for a set of dates, find the closest Sunday before each date. 
##
## This can be useful for splitting dates into weeks (tagging them by the 
## start date of the week containing them) or for constraining date ranges 
## to be bounded by specific weekdays.
##
## Input dates should be represented in the standard format ("yyyy-mm-dd").
## Output is a vector of date strings in the same format.
## Only a single weekday to use can be specified, by name (full or abbreviated) 
## or by number using the POSIX wday scheme (0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday,..., 
## 6 = Saturday).
## The default is to return the closest Sunday before the input dates.
## The function will return the closest weekday after the input dates by 
## setting after.date = TRUE.

        ## In the case of no match, default to Sunday.

            c("sunday", "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday",
